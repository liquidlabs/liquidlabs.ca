            <h2 class="mt-4">Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
            <p>These terms and conditions apply to the <b>H.K. Vision - Wallpapers</b> app (hereby referred to as "Application") for
                mobile
                devices that was created by Liquid Labs Inc. (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open
                Source
                service.</p>
            <p>Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It
                is
                strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.
                Unauthorized
                copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly
                prohibited.
                Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other
                languages, or
                create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other
                intellectual
                property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>
            <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as
                possible.
                As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and
                for any
                reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be
                clearly
                communicated to you.</p>
            <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in
                order to
                provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the
                Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which
                involves
                removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
                Such
                actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's
                security
                features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.</p>
            <div>
                <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and
                    Conditions. Below
                    are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the
                    Application:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google
                            Play
                            Services</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Google
                            Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase
                            Crashlytics</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some
                functions of
                the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile
                network
                provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full
                capacity
                due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p>
            <p>If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network
                provider's
                agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data
                usage during
                the connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept
                responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside
                of your
                home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer
                for the
                device on which you are using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the
                bill
                payer.</p>
            <p>Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application.
                For
                instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out
                of
                battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.</p>
            <p>In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to
                note that
                while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties
                to
                provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no
                liability
                for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this
                functionality of
                the application.</p>
            <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently
                available as
                per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the
                availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to
                continue
                using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the
                application so that
                it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your
                device.
                However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider
                may also
                wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing
                termination
                notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses
                granted to you
                in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from
                your
                device.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h3>
            <p>The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to
                review
                this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the
                new Terms
                and Conditions on this page.</p>
            <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2025-01-01</p>
