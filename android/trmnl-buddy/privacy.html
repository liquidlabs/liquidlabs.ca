            <p>This privacy policy applies to the <b>TRMNL Buddy</b> app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile
                devices
                that was created by Liquid Labs Inc. (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source
                service. This
                service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">Information Collection and Use</h3>
            <p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include

                <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on
                    those pages
                </li>
                <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
                <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>

            <p>The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

            <p>For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us

            <h3 class="mt-4">Third Party Access</h3>
            <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service
                Provider

                third
                parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>
            <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about
                handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by
                the

                Provider
                discover that a child under 13 has provided personal information, the Service Provider will immediately
                delete
                this from their servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided
                us with
                personal information, please contact the Service Provider (<code>liquidlabs.ca@gmail.com</code>) so that they will be
                able to
                take the necessary actions.</p>

                this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
